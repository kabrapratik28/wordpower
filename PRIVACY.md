# Privacy Policy for WordPower

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

Thank you for using WordPower. This privacy policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains how this extension handles data.

## 1. No Data Collection

This extension is designed with privacy as a top priority. We do not collect, store, track, or transmit any of your personal data. All processing and functionality occur entirely on your local machine. Your text, selections, and any information you work with are never sent to any remote server or third party.

## 2. Local Data Storage

The extension uses the browser's local storage (`chrome.storage`) to save your personal settings and preferences, such as your preferred AI model, custom prompts, and Ollama server configuration. This data is stored only on your computer and is never accessed by or transmitted to the developer or any other party.

## 3. Open Source and User Freedom

WordPower is a free and open-source project. The complete source code is available for public inspection, and you are free to copy, modify, and distribute it as you see fit, in accordance with the project's license (e.g., the MIT License). We believe in transparency and empower our users to verify our privacy claims by examining the code themselves.

## 4. Disclaimer of Liability

This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

In no event shall the authors, developers, or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. You use this software at your own risk. The developer assumes no responsibility for any legal issues or consequences that may arise from your use of this extension.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes.

## 6. Contact Us

As this is a free and open-source project maintained by a solo developer, formal support is not guaranteed. However, if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you are welcome to open an issue on our GitHub repository.
